# Tokenization for betterment of electoral process

## Imperial Token

* PoW : Voting
* Concept :
Each user/voter registers on the website with necessary creds and casts a vote on a candidate. Voting issues them a token, which in turn grants them discounts. The Government decides whether discounts are to be given to certain people of the society.

* Total vote count in the UK is calculated. Tokens are issed as per voting rate.

* People are encouraged to vote.
* Prevention of fraudulent cases.
